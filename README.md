# piano-physics-model
This is a simulation of a piano physics model, based on string-hammer-bridge-soundboard model.

The system is built mostly based on Bal√°zs Bank's work "A Modal-Based Real-Time Piano Synthesizer". This repo provides a document (Review_on_Physics_based_Piano_Sound_Synthesis_Tongyu.pdf) elaborating the model.

To run the simulation, run
```
python piano_hammer_string_soundboard_model.py
```
And the results (audio and waveform/spectrogram figures) will be automatically saved to the repo root. Before running the code, make sure that all dependencies in ```requirements.txt``` are installed.
