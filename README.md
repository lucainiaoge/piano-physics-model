# piano-physics-model
This is a simulation of a piano physics model, based on string-hammer-bridge-soundboard model.

The system is built mostly based on Bal√°zs Bank's work "A Modal-Based Real-Time Piano Synthesizer". This repo provides a document (Review_on_Physics_based_Piano_Sound_Synthesis_Tongyu.pdf) elaborating the model.
